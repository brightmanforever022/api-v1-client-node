# Blockchain MyWallet Module

Programmatically interact with your Blockchain.info wallet. [View full API documentation](https://blockchain.info/api/blockchain_wallet_api).

## Opening a wallet

Importing:

```js
var MyWallet = require('blockchain.info/MyWallet')
```

An instance of a wallet needs to be initialized before it can be used:

```js
var wallet = new MyWallet(identifier, password, options)
```

Options:

  * `secondPassword` - second wallet password (required only if wallet is double-encrypted)
  * `apiCode` - Blockchain.info api code (will be automatically included in all further requests to the wallet)
  * `apiHost` - set the host for the api calls (required)

## Wallet API v2 Compatibility

This module requires the [Wallet API v2 service](https://github.com/blockchain/service-my-wallet-v3). To use the wallet service for api calls, set the `apiHost` option to point to where the service is running.

Example:

```js
var options = { apiCode: 'myAPICode', apiHost: 'http://localhost:3000' }
var wallet = new MyWallet('myIdentifier', 'myPassword123', options)
wallet.getBalance().then(function (response) { console.log('My balance is %d!', response.balance); })
```

## Response objects

Payment Response Object Properties:

  * `to` - payment destinations (*[string|number]*)
  * `amounts` - payment amounts (*[number]*)
  * `from` - from account / address (*string|number*)
  * `fee` - final fee paid in satoshi (*number*)
